== Overview
You can allow developers to create their own projects. An accessible endpoint
exists that will provision a project according to a
link:../dev_guide/templates.html[template]. This endpoint is made accessible
when a developer link:../dev_guide/projects.html[creates a new project].

== Template for New Projects
The API server automatically provisions projects based on the template that is
defined in the `projectRequestTemplate` parameter of the *_master-config.yaml_*
file. If the parameter is not defined, the API server creates a default template
that creates a project with the requested name, and assigns the requesting user
to the "admin" role for that project.

You can create your own custom template by using the below as an example, and
defining the desired template's location in the *_master-config.yaml_* file:

.Example New Project Template
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: project-request
  namespace: openshift
objects:
- apiVersion: v1beta1
  displayName: ${PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME}
  kind: Project
  metadata:
    annotations:
      description: ${PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
      displayName: ${PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME}
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  spec: {}
  status: {}
- apiVersion: v1beta1
  groupNames: []
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admins
    namespace: ${PROJECT_NAME}
  roleRef:
    name: admin
  userNames:
  - ${PROJECT_ADMIN_USER}
parameters:
- name: PROJECT_NAME <1>
- name: PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME <2>
- name: PROJECT_DESCRIPTION <3>
- name: PROJECT_ADMIN_USER <4>
----

<1> The name of the project
<2> The display name of the project. Defaults to *PROJECT_NAME*.
<3> The description of the project. Defaults to *PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME*.
<4> The name of the requesting user.

////
The API substitutes the following parameters into the template:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|*PROJECT_NAME*
|The name of the project

|*PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME*
|The display name of the project. Defaults to *PROJECT_NAME*.

|*PROJECT_DESCRIPTION*
|The description of the project. Defaults to *PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME*.

|*PROJECT_ADMIN_USER*
|The name of the requesting user.
|===
////

Access to the API is granted to developers with the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[`self-provisioner`
role] and the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding. This role is available
to all authenticated developers by default.

== Disabling Self-provisioning
Deleting the `self-provisioners`
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster role
binding] will deny permissions for self-provisioning any new projects. When
disabling self-provisioning, set the `projectRequestMessage` parameter in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file instructing developers on how to request a new
project. This parameter is a string that will be presented to the developer in
the web console and command line when they attempt to self-provision a project.
For example:

----
Contact your system administrator at projectname@example.com to request a project.
----

or:

----
To request a new project, fill out the project request form located at
https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request.
----
